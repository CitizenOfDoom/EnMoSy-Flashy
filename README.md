# EnMoSy-Flashy
Homework assignment Number 01 for EnMoSy by Virginia Jagusch

I am not sure whether or not your homework submissions actually require readmes, and feel free to skip this if they don't, although I do feel like the code needs some explanation, mostly based on the fact that it absolutely does not work. 
I have encountered several more questions/problems while doing this exercise, and I would kindly ask you for another office hour to discuss them, as a few of my classmates and internet tutorials tried to explain these things to me, but I just keep getting lost.

My questions can be boiled down to these two topics: Communication between components and management of the Flatlist component. To be more precise, I understand how the flow of information between component works on principle, with a parent component passing props to a child and the child returning (the potentially changed) information via a callback function. In practise, I failed to implement these cases in such a way to make them actually work and to actually pass the information properly.
In the Flatlist component, I failed to understand how to properly map the buttons in such a way that each Button would only do its assigned function for the respective listitem (which, now that I think about it, is another communication issue).
